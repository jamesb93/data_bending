236 - cascading, phasing, synchronisatione vents on the bottom sample
165 - spherics, highly detailed, waiting between samples
33, 
36 - using this as a backbone based on spectrum/loudness. HIghly varied and has an interesting morphology when left for a medium period of time.

### 100 / 61
A structure whereby an oscillation between the main group (with a fixed structure) and sub groups. Kind of like an in->out->in feeling.
The structure could be formed through clever selection of probabilities and groups at all levels pitting 61 as a major branch out of 100


## Short, Fast , Delicate

Using their inherent timings by concatenation as rhythmic characteristics of the cluster.
I feel like this one could be like an autonomous machine that is changing states isorhythmically. A bunch of layered states that interact and overlap.
create a hierarchy of samples perhaps

## 181
The natural rhythm and drunken-ness of the samples is really nice. There is a pitched element which hides behind the noise. Perhaps we cna do some sort of NMF thing that lets it poke through over the noise

## 118
Using group 118 > 137 > 1214 against group 118. Works well when 118 > 137 > 29 is pasted on top of it
118 > 374 > 463 > 2593 also has a certain charm to it like 118 > 137 > 29
I think that use of the delay here to make it more choppy is possibly excellent Weaving things in between the sample groups

## 162
The gritty ASMR nature of the sound combined sounds that are strained, compressed and otherwise being pushed through the speaker against their will. Some of the spines would work well to accompany these sounds from the `.maxwave` groups and `.dat` and `.cache`.


## 184
Amazing detail and gesture - definitely something to be explored here especailly as there are only sub clusters at level 2

## 210
Try out group `318` and also 318 > 644 > 2048

## 142
There is something in the jumpcut nature of this one

## 226
An exploration of tearing textures. THis one requires extended listening to get 'trapped' into the tearing sound. Try and create abstainations from change somehow??

## 249
OTG.SLAM~ the shit out of this one and use the pitchiness and melodic capacity of each group
Think about perhaps just getting a structure out through improvised selection of groups and then post-processing

## 157
UBER pitched kind of strange phased melodies


## 138
138 - noise vs pitch? overall kinda loud and shapeless
138 > 351 > 351 > 1691 (PITCHED) the distribution can really shake things up especially on single sample repeats
138 > 469 > 1296 > 1296 (ANOTHER KIND OF PITCHED)
138 > 351 > 351 > 2107 (NOISE)
138 > 469 > 1006 > 1006 (SOMETHING ELSE)


142 - contains ur favourite AMDGPUdesc and some really snappy samples. Refer to the 'bridges' statement below. Volume is definitely a parameter in here

6 -> 256 -> 1480
6 > 362 > 643 > 715 **
6 > 61 > 1552 > 1552
6 > 256 > 1418 > 
6 > 362 > 178

216, bifurcating stream, deriving groove from the groupings
246, bifurcating stream

further_investigation:
97 (playing with groupings within groupings - top end vs bottom end)

97 -> 175 -> 296
181 - increasing in complexity and length of loop. play with shifting two adjacent probabilities across the z12 multislider
212 (pitched lines) - rotating small groupings and growing/shrinking the size of the groupings.

228: fat lowness like a printer
228 -> 56 -> 1426/1475
226: raw_noise

138

165 > 666 > 895 / 2126




Overall:

Thinking about how you can connect or weave between different clusters. Perhaps creating different 'bridges' between them and creating a more general network.
