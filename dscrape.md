I have experimented with manual manipulation of the 'field_recording' exemplar. The files rendered from scraping the harddrive come out at various lengths and have different experiential properties when looped. It's a simple way to create an intensive listening environment as one has to peer through the distortion/noise/glitches to the underlying behaviour of the sound.

Now considering how the computer might create chains of these samples and how it would decide to change the loop.

How can I expand the set of sounds to be greater, creating variety between iterations or perhaps more density. Just MORE selection properties and the possibility of creating greater transition

A system for boredom. Correlate?

Listening to various 'spines' that have emerged from the classification process I came across (by chance) the Live-files_34.db. Listening to the various cuts that were made I was intrigued how the original version sounded. It displays a somewhat random, broad and all over the shape behaviour but each slice in and of itself is quite interesting. How can I reorganise the slices? I feel compelled to try something like simulated annealing again to create a search pattern that can be sonified or otherwise accessed as an organisation structure.

Today I produced excellent results in creating conceptually coherent groupings using a more advanced and contemporary set of dimensionality reduction techniques.

The process is as follows.

1. Compute t-SNE dimensionality reduction using the script and associated yaml file. This produces a json file containing two dimensional coordinates for each file's position in a space
2. Run DBSCAN using the output of t-SNE as the input data. This produces a JSON file containing keys (clusters) and values(audio belonging to those clusters)
3. Use the cluster_explorer max patch to listen to the playback of samples within a cluster

I think that I find this interesting because I have taken a very dense and slow to navigate space and had the computer make quite close conceptual groupings out of material that has not necessarily been derived from the same data in the initial scraping process. It has allowed me to collect materials and organise them so that they have coherence. I can then disrupt this coherence or use it, but it gives me a more stable place to start from when approaching organisation and selection of materials.

Aesthetically, I am trying to create small pieces that are focused intensenly on a specific motif or material type. The clustering produces not only perceptually 'smooth' groupings giving me more technica manipulation/finesse/control/understanding of the entire data set, but is throwing at me groups which would otherwise take ages to collect. I am particularly interested in how these groupings might be filled with their own 'special features' as well as what might happen when I start to unpack the structures within the clusters either progrmatically, perceptually or using another control mechanism to turn it from a list of samples -> texture or stream of sound.

The large database in and of itself is not that interesting, but it is more interesting to disect the novel features of the space.
