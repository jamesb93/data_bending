I have experimented with manual manipulation of the 'field_recording' exemplar. The files rendered from scraping the harddrive come out at various lengths and have different experiential properties when looped. It's a simple way to create an intensive listening environment as one has to peer through the distortion/noise/glitches to the underlying behaviour of the sound.

Now considering how the computer might create chains of these samples and how it would decide to change the loop.

How can I expand the set of sounds to be greater, creating variety between iterations or perhaps more density. Just MORE selection properties and the possibility of creating greater transition

A system for boredom. Correlate?

Listening to various 'spines' that have emerged from the classification process I came across (by chance) the Live-files_34.db. Listening to the various cuts that were made I was intrigued how the original version sounded. It displays a somewhat random, broad and all over the shape behaviour but each slice in and of itself is quite interesting. How can I reorganise the slices? I feel compelled to try something like simulated annealing again to create a search pattern that can be sonified or otherwise accessed as an organisation structure.
